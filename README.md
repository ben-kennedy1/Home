Personal website created using Next.js & TypeScript

_I took a ton of design inspiration from [Alistair](https://github.com/alii) - go check their site out [here](https://alistair.sh)!_

## Development

```
yarn install && yarn dev
```

## Usage

If you'd like to use this as a template for your own site, please leave my name in the footer and credit me in the repository README!

### 🚧 WIP

This site is still under construction, but I've made the repo public so that people can check it out while I'm working on it.
Here's what still needs to be done:

- [x] GitHub pins
- [x] WakaTime integration
- [ ] Discord presence
